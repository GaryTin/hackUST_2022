# 🔨Built With

This website is developed with **Python Django Framework**, **Web3.py**, **Web3.js**, j**Query** and **Chart.js**. It does not contain any web templates online.

For development purpose, the smart contact used in this project is now deployed on the public blockchain, **Ropsten Ethereum Test Network**. The speed of reading and writing data may be slow, while writing data may even take longer time. The speed is solely depending on the blockchain traffic. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. 

In a real implementation, the smart contract will deploy on a self-developed blockchain instead of a public blockchain, which can greatly improve the read-write speed.

## 💭Assumptions

- We assume that Retailer’s POS system will only scan(input) their own procured products (which are bought from the Manufacturer). Random data input may lead to undefined behaviors as scanning products that do not exist in the store will not happen in real-life operations.

# ❓FAQ

## Can I register as Manufacturer or Retailer myself?

No, you cannot. For security reason, only the smart contract owner can modify the list of manufacturers and retailers. We are sorry that it is impossible for any other users to register their own addresses as a manufacturer or a retailer.
